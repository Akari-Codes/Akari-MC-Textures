You also step back into\n§§    this pose after you stop walking.§r\n§§  §o§7- Attack animations, and a Lunge animation when using the Lunge\n§§    enchantment.§r\n§§  §o§7- A fatigued animation plays when the spear is held for too long,\n§§    before lowering.§r\n§§  §o§7- A new jousting animation and pose when riding the horse whilst\n§§    using a spear. The same animation applies to mobs that can ride\n§§    horses whilst holding a spear.§r\n§§  §o§7- Zombies and Husks now use a new attack animation when holding\n§§    a spear. Their first strike uses the spear itself, and if they\n§§    land a follow-up hit quickly, they switch to an offhand swing for\n§§    the second attack.§r\n\n- Nautilus\n§§  §o§7- Textures for the Nautilus, Zombie Nautilus, and Zombie Coral\n§§    Nautilus.§r\n§§  §o§7- Custom 3D armour.§r\n§§  §o§7- Two ride animations which are used depending on the Nautilus'\n§§    state. The player will swim on top while underwater, or sit on\n§§    top when near to the water's surface. Some items also\n§§    trigger the sitting pose underwater. A transition animation\n§§    blends between the two states.§r\n§§  §o§7- Riding animations for the player which bank side-to-side,\n§§    as well as up and down. The Nautilus' beak also reacts to\n§§    turning.§r\n§§  §o§7- Leg kicking animation when swimming with the Nautilus\n§§    which reacts to movement speed.§r\n§§  §o§7- Animated saddle straps that respond to motion, especially\n§§    noticeable when moving downwards.§r\n§§  §o§7- Bubbles emit from the Nautilus' beak while moving\n§§    or boosting.§r\n§§  §o§7- Breath of the Nautilus effect UI texture.§r\n§§  §o§7- Empty Nautilus armour slot UI texture.§r\n§§  §o§7- Vibrant Visuals textures.§r\n§§  §o§7- Two nametags.

The set is now complete!\n- Spawn eggs for the Nautilus, Zombie Nautilus, Camel Husk,\n§§   and Parched.\n\n\n\n§lNew Content§r\n- Snowy mob variants: Many mobs now appear with a snow covered\n§§   texture when spawned in a cold biomes. You can also use the\n§§   nametags §6Snowy§r or §6Frosty§r. See the nametags section\n§§   for details on all of the affected mobs.\n\n- Snowy Feet & Boots: When running on snow, your skin's feet will\n§§   gain a snowy overlay texture. The overlay is also applied\n§§   if you're wearing boots. §o§7Snowy feet is currently not\n§§   available on console as it does not work with persona or\n§§   character creator skins. (However Snowy boots do work!)§r\n\n- Snowy Footprints: Footprints are now left in the snow as you\n§§   walk, lasting for about 10 seconds before fading. After\n§§   stepping in snow, you'll briefly leave small snowy patches\n§§   on regular ground as your feet track the snow.\n§§   §o§7Currently, this only works on Snow Layers, but we\n§§   will implement it for Snow Blocks and other block types\n§§   at a later date.§r\n\n- 5 Costumes: Leather armour can now be transformed into\n§§   themed costumes by applying specific armour trims.\n§§   Each trim swaps the leather piece into its matching\n§§   costume set. Time to head out and track down those\n§§   trims! §o§7Costumes can also be placed on to mobs by\n§§   using a dispenser.§r\n§§  - Rana Puffercoat: \"Shaper Trim\" - Found in Trail Ruins\n§§  - Elf Attire: \"Wild Trim\" Found in Jungle Temples\n§§  - Santa Getup: \"Snout Trim\" - Found in Bastions\n§§  - Viking Armour: \"Rib Trim\" - Found in Nether Fortresses\n§§  - Actions & Stuff Set: \"Host Trim\" - Found in Ocean Monuments\n\n- First-person armour: You will now see your equipped chestplate\n§§   while attacking and performing other animations in first\n§§   person. This applies only to chestplate armour. §o§7Dyed\n§§   leather armour currently appears in its undyed form.\n§§   Costumes will not display in first person.§r\n\n- Snow Layer Height Increase: Your feet will now stand on top of\n§§   the Snow Layer block rather than sinking 2 pixels inside of\n§§   it. This improvement makes the Snowy Feet & Boots look\n§§   better, as well as avoids clipping.\n\n- Armour Height Increase: When wearing boots, your character will\n§§   be a pixel taller in height. This improvement makes it so\n§§   boots no longer clip into the ground, but rather stand on\n§§   the ground correctly.\n\n- Goat Horn Variant: Goats now have 8 horn variations, 4 large\n§§   and 4 small. There's an 80%% chance they'll have small\n§§   horns and a 20%% chance they'll have large horns.\n\n- Re-textured Frozen UI texture when standing inside of Powder\n§§   Snow.\n\n- Added two new biome-specific animations to the idle animation\n§§   pool:\n§§  §o§7- In warm biomes, the player appears tired and drops their\n§§    shoulders.§r\n§§  §o§7- In cold biomes, the player shivers and rubs their\n§§    shoulder. Wearing leather armour provides warmth and\n§§    prevents this animation from playing.§r\n\n- Signs have been made pixel accurate. In Vanilla they are 12px,\n§§   but they should be 8px.\n\n- Added pixel accurate face to the Snow Golem. It use to be 16px\n§§   and it is now 12. It looks much cuter!\n\n- Added stem and leaf to the top of the Snow Golem head.\n\n- Added empty horse saddle slot UI texture.\n\n- Added fish, ride and mount button UI textures for pocket edition.\n\n- Added Mooshroom Tails.\n\n- Added pixel-accurate Magma Cube and Slime texture.\n\n- Added NPC spawn egg. This was previously not possible,\n§§   but now is.\n\n\n\n§l§eProps§r\n- Stockings (Leather Boots Item): Dye a pair of Leather Boots\n§§    to get a unique Stocking design with a special toy inside.\n§§    Some stockings require multiple dyes to be created.\n§§   §o§7Fun Fact: Several designs were created from personal\n§§   stocking concepts submitted by the team!§r\n§lOne Dye variants§r\n- Kitty Cat (§6White§r)\n- Chess & Games Controller (§6Light Gray§r)\n- Redstoner (§6Gray§r)\n- Penguin (§6Black§r)\n- Actions & Stuff Rana (§6Pink§r)\n- Enderman (§6Magena§r)\n- Bee Lover (§6Purple§r)\n- Classic Stocking (§6Red§r)\n- Flame (§6Orange§r)\n- Actions & Stuff Flint (§6Yellow§r)\n- Classic Stocking (§6Green§r)\n- Robot (§6Lime§r)\n- Electronics (§6Cyan§r)\n- Voltar (§6Light Blue§r)\n- Vibe Cat (§6Blue§r)\n- Cowboy (§6Brown§r)\n\n§lTwo Dye Variants§r\n- Woodland Critter (§6Green & Brown§r)\n- Lion (§6Orange & Yellow§r)\n- Musical Knight (§6Green & Black§r)\n- Dinosaur (§6Green & Yellow§r)\n- Alien (§6Gray & Lime§r)\n- Mustache Man (§6Brown & Black§r)\n- Coding Error (§6Magenta & Black§r)\n- Wizard (§6Red & Magenta§r)\n\n§lPlushies §o§7Interact animation & sounds!§r\n- Sheep (§6White Wool§r)\n- Chicken (§6Light Gray Wool§r)\n- Skeleton (§6Gray Wool§r)\n- Spider (§6Black Wool§r)\n- Cold Cow (§6Brown Wool§r)\n- Mooshroom (§6Red Wool§r)\n- Frog (§6Orange Wool§r)\n- Bee (§6Yellow Wool§r)\n- Rana (§6Lime Wool§r)\n- Creeper (§6Green Wool§r)\n- Zombie (§6Cyan Wool§r)\n- Pufferfish (§6Light Blue Wool§r)\n- Squid §o§7Interact to turn it into a Glow Squid!§r (§6Blue Wool§r)\n- Enderman (§6Purple Wool§r)\n- Axolotl (§6Magenta Wool§r)\n- Pig (§6Pink Wool§r)\n- Happy Ghast & Dried Ghast §o§7Interact to flip between them!§r\n§§   (§6Dried Ghast§r)\n- Ender Dragon (§6Dragon's Breath§r)\n- Warden (§6Sculk Vein§r)\n- Rabbit (§6Rabbit's Foot§r)\n\n§lPresents§r §o§7Interact animation & sounds!§r\n- Creaking (§6White Bundle§r)\n- Dried Ghast (§6Light Gray Bundle§r)\n- Coal (§6Gray Bundle§r)\n- Panda (§6Black Bundle§r)\n- Kitty Cat (§6Brown Bundle§r)\n- Snowgolem (§6Red Bundle§r)\n- Strider (§6Orange Bundle§r)\n- Bee (§6Yellow Bundle§r)\n- TNT (§6Lime Bundle§r)\n- Iron Golem (§6Green Bundle§r)\n- Festive Fruit (§6Cyan Bundle§r)\n- Wolf (§6Light Blue Bundle§r)\n- Copper Golem Robot (§6Blue Bundle§r)\n- Enderman (§6Purple Bundle§r)\n- Pig (§6Magenta Bundle§r)\n- Teddy Bear (§6Pink Bundle§r)\n- Money Money Money (§6Default Bundle§r)\n- Sleigh (§6Mangrove Boat Item§r)\n- Fireplace (§6Furnace Block§r) §o§7Flame particles & sounds!§r\n- Green Candy Cane (§6Twisting Vines Item§r) §o§7Place Armour Stand\n§§   at 45 degree angle for a big Candy Cane.§r\n- Red Candy Cane (§6Weeping Vines Item§r) §o§7Place Armour Stand at\n§§   45 degree angle for a big Candy Cane.§r\n- Chimney (§6Brick Block§r) §o§7Smoke particles!§r\n- Potted Holly Bush (§6Sweet Berries Item§r)\n- Wreath (§6Spruce Leaves Block§r)\n- Toy Train (§6Rail Item§r)\n- Small Snowglobe (§6Snowball Item§r)\n- Large Snowglobe (§6Powder Snow Bucket Item§r) §o§7Interact to shake\n§§   it up!§r\n- Party Balloon (§6Pufferfish Item§r) §o§7Interact to see different\n§§   balloons!§r\n- Strider Party Pinata (§6Warped Fungus on a Stick Item§r)\n§§    §o§7Dynamic whack animation!§r\n- Llama Party Pinata (§6Warped Fungus on a Stick Item§r)\n§§    §o§7Dynamic whack animation!§r\n- Party Cake (§6Cake Block§r)\n- Pillow Fort (§6Feather Item§r)\n- 16 Rugs (§6Carpet Blocks§r) §o§7Interact to toggle between a carpet\n§§   and a rug.§r\n- Christmas Tree (§6Spruce Sapling Item§r)\n- Snow Pile (§6Diamond Shovel Item§r)\n- Festive Candle (§6White Candle Block§r)\n- Gingerbread House (§6Cocoa Beans§r) §o§7Knock on the front door a\n§§   few times to trigger a greeting animation.
